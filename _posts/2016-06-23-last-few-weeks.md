**Blog post on last few weeks**

The last few weeks have been quite good and i have learnt a lot about social media.

Making my Identity Map was quite hard because i couldn't think about my personality and things i liked.

I found sharing my map with the class the way we did was quite helpful because it was a good way to get feedback so i can do better next time.

I liked commenting on other peoples work because it is helpful to see their work and then they can see how you think of their work.

I liked how we did our lessons and i think it really helped me in understanding the topic.

I liked getting a few of the comments back but there was a few that were a bit annoying and made my work seem rubbish.

This process was quite different to social media because with this you kind of know who was giving you info by their handwriting but with social media it is completely anonymous.

My identity map didn't help me think about what i would post more or less often because i donâ€™t have social media.

As i said i don't use social media so i would not change anything.

I already knew most of the things about social media and i did not really learn anything new.

I don't use social media yet, but when i do i will be a lot more careful about what i post.
