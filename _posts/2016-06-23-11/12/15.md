Today i learn't how to change my background and the colour of the different words. First you had to go to html color picker and find a colour you want then click on it will come up with 6 digit code there is also letters from A-F. You then go to github and go to your repositories and click on the one you want to change the colour of. then you scroll down to where it says style.scss and click on this. After that you go and edit it and scroll down to where body is written in green and change the background and the colour you can also scroll down to where it says h1 h2 h3 h4 h5 h6 and change the colour of that to.
