In today's lesson we went on the bbc microbit website where we use three types of coding languages, Javascripts, Block Editor and Touch Develop. I loved how when you hear you are going to learn coding languages you are expecting it to be very hard and not that easy. I did the tutorials for the three of them and then i focused on Block Editor because it was my favourite. Try to create a little equation of 1+1=2 but i also try to get 2 or 1 to get pick randomly and if it said 2 it got a tick and if it said 1 it would get a cross. At the end i create when i press a button it would do 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 and go.
