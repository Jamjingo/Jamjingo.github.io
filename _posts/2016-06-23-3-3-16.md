In today's lesson we watch a video which was about a girl and a boy racing her friends to reach one million views first and at the end on the first it would ask you a question saying do you want them to race or not only me and three friends said no and all the rest said yes so we did yes when we clicked on yes it took us to another movie they had made you kept doing this till the end. Now after the video i have learnt that posting things on the internet that are meant only to be know either by just you or you and someone else can go viral in seconds and if you don't react very soon it could even cost you something very big
