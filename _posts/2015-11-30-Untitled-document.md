In my IT lesson today we were building/creating this website. At the beginning of the lesson when he told us we were going to be creating a website i got really excited but i soon found out that it was a lot more complicated than just a few details you had to put in.

I was really good at downloading gabriel and getting everything set up because i was the first one to finish pretty much every time.

Now onto the stuff i found difficult, i was flying ahead up until the annoying part when we had to upload everything and i got really stuck.

Well now you kind of know that it is not as easy building a website that you would think

Look out for the next post next week
